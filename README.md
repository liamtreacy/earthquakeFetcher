EarthQuake Fetcher
=============


Program which retreives information on the latest earth quake (using API from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_hour.geojson ) and displays the text information. The latitude and longitude are parsed and then used with Google Maps to show a location for the earth quake.

Thanks to the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program for providing this fascinatingly informative API.
