Vague idea...

Summary: Web page (served locally) which displays earthquake data (biggest, latest etc)

Do in .Net
Use a db
Use RabbitMq (if possible)




1) A service which Gets the data and populates a db
... vague

When retrieved or new data got, a new rabbit message is sent.

Another service can be queried to return biggest, latest etc.

If you get a rabbit saying there's new data available, then you could query that other service.

Add Cucumber tests around ExternalDataRetrieverService
Add GetLatest, Biggest mag

Just write the cucumber tests in anothe language?
